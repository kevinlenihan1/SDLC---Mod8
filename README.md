# SDLC---Mod8
Module 8 assignment for SDLC 
When I develop software, understanding what users need and why is essential to creating something useful. I start by asking questions, listening to feedback, and focusing on solving real problems rather than just adding features. I rely on user stories—short statements that explain what a user wants to achieve, like “As a student, I want to sort courses alphabetically to find what I need.” This keeps my focus on the user’s goals and helps me build features that add real value. Agile methods, like daily check-ins, sprints, and team reflections, help me stay focused, work in small, manageable steps, and adapt based on feedback. This way, I can make quick improvements and keep up with changing needs. To be a good team member, I communicate openly, support others, meet deadlines, and stay open to learning. Collaboration and flexibility strengthen the team, making us more effective at meeting user needs. By focusing on user needs, using user stories, following Agile practices, and being a reliable teammate, I can create software that truly helps people and continues to add value over time.
